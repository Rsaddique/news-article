# Starting up

Firstly, given repo is being cloned in order to use for this project. NPM is being install along with all required packeges. As we have started the project after july, 2020 so we have used the MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API for this project so we don't need API ID. In order to continue, we have install dotenv and created env file and added API key in it.

Further, we have created gitignore file and added node_modules, dist and env files in it. Afterwards, we have set up servers and test communication between them in order to test the results. 

We have also added get and post requests in order to recieve data from meaningcloud and post is to out app. We have tested the results from different websites. 

After completing that, we have added jest frame work to our project so that we can perform tests. For this purpose, we have created a -test-  folder and added two spec files in it. Later, we have added two tests into these files. In order to confirm, we ran those test and see the results.

After testings, we have added service workers to our project to achive offline availablity to local server.
